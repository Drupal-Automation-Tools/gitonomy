How it works
============

Easy-to-setup
-------------

Gitonomy is a dead-simple PHP-MySQL application running git commands on your
repositories.

Application relies on MySQL and PHP 5.3. Repositories are accesible with SSH
or local access.

Flexible architecture
---------------------

Software is open-source so you can easily come up and hack software. You can
watch some events and make actions on your repositories.
